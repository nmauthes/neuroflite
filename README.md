# NΞUROFLITΞ

NΞUROFLITΞ ("Neuro Flyer Lite") is a mobile game/relaxation aid created in Unity and written in C#. Users can control the game using a [Muse brain-sensing headband](http://www.choosemuse.com/).

The idea is to guide the floating diamond through the passing rings. To score points, the user tries to increase their "mellow score" (represented by a rolling average of alpha wave activity) by relaxing and thus increasing the likelihood of passing through each ring.

Created for the CS280 (Neurofeedback in Computing) class at SJSU.
